# Overview

This program was created with the purpose of showcasing basic concepts like control flow,
variables, loops, functions, and object oriented programming in the Rust programming language

These concepts were used for the creation of a simple hangman game done in the terminal, you can
choose from different categories to get a random word. If you guess the word before the hanged man
is drawn you win.
